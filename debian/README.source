To package the upstream source the 3 svn repos are extracted to the same folder:
<packaging folder>/
	 kicad/
	 kicad-doc/
	 kicad-library/

Then, because we aren't building and it has a different license, we remove the
kicad/kicad/minizip/ folder.
We also remove some outdated docs, stuff that we don't ship because it's not up
to date. As soon as it gets updated it will get restored.

See packagesrc.sh, the script used to build the source package.
